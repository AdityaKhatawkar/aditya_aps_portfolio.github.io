<div class="justified">
  <strong>Scenario:</strong> A large video is split into smaller chunks and uploaded in parallel to multiple regional servers (nearby CDNs) to reduce latency and respect bandwidth constraints.

  <em>Figure 1: Large video getting broken down into fixed sized chunks to be uploaded into regional servers.</em>
</div>

<div class="justified">
  <strong>Theory:</strong> This maps to a scheduling/knapsack-style problem: each chunk is a ‚Äújob‚Äù with a size (upload time), and we allocate jobs across parallel channels. A DP solution leverages optimal substructure‚Äîknowing the best schedule for the first k‚Äì1 chunks lets us extend it optimally to the k<sup>th</sup> chunk.
</div>

<div class="justified">
  <strong>Application:</strong> For example, the upload client splits files into GOP-aligned segments and uses DP to assign large segments over high-bandwidth links and smaller ones over slower links. This balance minimizes total upload time and idle bandwidth on any connection.
</div>

<h4>Challenges:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Handling very large totals (sum of chunk sizes in the tens or hundreds of gigabytes can make DP tables huge)</li>
  <li>Adapting quickly to sudden changes in server load or network congestion</li>
</ul>

<h4>Market Benefits:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>‚ö° Reduced overall upload latency</li>
  <li>ü§ù Better distribution of load across regions</li>
  <li>üìà Higher creator satisfaction through reliable, fast ingestion</li>
</ul>

<h4>Design techniques and algorithms:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Dynamic Programming</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Description:</strong> Builds a table of ‚Äúreachable‚Äù total-load states per server, then finds the assignment minimizing the maximum finish time.</li>
      <li><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> O(N √ó S √ó K)</li>
      <li><strong>Space Complexity:</strong> O(N √ó K)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
