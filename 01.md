##Content Delivery Network (CDN) Server Selection

<div class="justified">**Scenario:** A large video is split into smaller chunks and uploaded in parallel to multiple regional servers (nearby CDNs) to reduce latency and respect bandwidth constraints.</div>



<div class="justified">**Theory:** This maps to a scheduling/knapsack-style problem: each chunk is a “job” with a size (upload time), and we allocate jobs across parallel channels. A DP solution leverages optimal substructure—knowing the best schedule for the first k–1 chunks lets us extend it optimally to the kᵗʰ chunk.</div>

<div class="justified">**Application:** For example, the upload client splits files into GOP-aligned segments and uses DP to assign large segments over high-bandwidth links and smaller ones over slower links. This balance minimizes total upload time and idle bandwidth on any connection.</div>
