<div style="text-align: justify;">

Founded in 2005 and acquired by Google in 2006, YouTube has evolved from a simple video-sharing site into a massive, data-driven platform that powers content discovery, creator monetization, and user engagement at a global scale. With over 2.7 billion monthly active users and more than 500 hours of video uploaded every minute, YouTube operates at an unmatched scale, requiring advanced algorithmic intelligence to manage and optimize operations [1].

In recent years, YouTube has witnessed a massive boom in short-form content with the launch of YouTube Shorts, a feature introduced to compete with TikTok and Instagram Reels. By 2024, YouTube Shorts had surpassed 70 billion daily views globally [2]. Forrester Research reports that 29% of U.S. Gen Z online adults now use YouTube Shorts at least weekly ‚Äî underscoring how bite-sized video is reshaping attention spans and engagement patterns [3].

What makes YouTube unique is not just its scale, but the way it handles business-critical challenges such as content recommendation, ad targeting, trend detection, and moderation. These are deeply rooted in a backbone of data structures and algorithms (DSA). Whether it's ranking the best video for a user, optimizing live video delivery, or filtering spam ‚Äî YouTube‚Äôs success is a triumph in algorithmic problem-solving.

This portfolio explores YouTube‚Äôs real-world business cases and demonstrates how core DSA techniques can be applied to model and solve them efficiently.

### üèóÔ∏è YouTube System Architecture Overview
Having spent hours surfing YouTube every day, I‚Äôve often found myself wondering:
><em>‚ÄúHow does all of this actually work?‚Äù</em><br>
><em>‚ÄúHow are videos fetched so efficiently?‚Äù</em><br>
><em>‚ÄúHow is such a large amount of content, creator, and viewer data stored?‚Äù</em><br>
><em>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt the servers get overloaded with requests? how is that managed?‚Äù</em><br>
><em>‚ÄúHow are video bitrates adapted?‚Äù</em><br>
><em>‚ÄúHow does the video recommendation work?‚Äù</em><br>
><em>‚ÄúHow is content violating DMCA detected?‚Äù</em><br>

Below is a concise overview of how YouTube‚Äôs core systems handle video from upload through delivery. This high-level architecture lays the groundwork for the business cases we‚Äôll explore next.

*Figure 1: High-level YouTube system design illustrating user upload servers, transcoding clusters, video storage, CDNs, metadata services, and recommendation pipelines.* [4]

1. **User Client ‚Üí Upload Servers**  
   - **Creators** upload raw video files via web or mobile clients.  
   - Requests pass through a **load balancer** to an **Upload/Web Server**, which writes the file into durable blob storage.

2. **Transcoding & Storage**  
   - A fleet of **Transcoding Servers** retrieves uploads and encodes them into multiple resolutions (144p, 480p, 1080p, etc.).  
   - Transcoded segments are stored in a distributed **Video Storage** layer; metadata (titles, IDs, thumbnails) is indexed in a **Metadata Store** (e.g., Bigtable, Spanner).

3. **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**  
   - Popular and newly uploaded content is replicated to edge **CDN** nodes worldwide.  
   - Viewers fetch video chunks from the nearest CDN via adaptive-bitrate protocols (MPEG-DASH, HLS) to minimize latency.

4. **Viewer Playback Path**  
   - A **Viewer** requests a video; the client contacts the closest CDN edge.  
   - Cache misses trigger a fetch from the origin storage.  
   - **Adaptive streaming algorithms** and **real-time analytics** determine the optimal segment quality.

5. **Metadata & Recommendations**  
   - Meanwhile, the client‚Äôs API calls hit the **API Server**, which queries the **Metadata Store** for user history and video stats.  
   - **Recommendation engines** (graph-based, collaborative filtering) generate personalized ‚ÄúUp Next‚Äù and homepage feeds.

This end-to-end pipeline built on load balancers, distributed storage, transcoding clusters, CDNs, and recommendation services forms the foundation for all the business-critical scenarios in this portfolio. In the sections that follow, we‚Äôll dive into specific cases and show how Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) techniques solve them efficiently.

## üíº Business Cases

### 1. YouTube Video Comments Management

Managing the vast number of comments on YouTube videos requires intelligent systems to filter spam, detect toxicity, and highlight meaningful interactions. This business case explores how backend systems and algorithms can improve user engagement and maintain community standards.

### 2. YouTube Copyright Infringement Detection

With millions of videos uploaded daily, YouTube faces the challenge of identifying copyrighted content in real time. This business case focuses on how data structures, pattern matching, and scalable backend systems can help detect and handle copyright violations efficiently.

### 3. Cost-Optimized Resource Allocation

Google Cloud dynamically allocates resources based on cost and performance constraints. This problem can be modeled using **DP (Knapsack-like problems)** where the goal is to maximize resource usage within a cost or performance budget.
