<div class="justified">
  <p>
    Founded in 2005 and acquired by Google in 2006, YouTube has evolved from a simple video-sharing site into a massive, data-driven platform that powers content discovery, creator monetization, and user engagement at a global scale. With over <strong>2.7 billion monthly active users</strong> and more than <strong>500 hours of video uploaded every minute</strong>, YouTube operates at an unmatched scale, requiring advanced algorithmic intelligence to manage and optimize operations <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    In recent years, YouTube has witnessed a massive boom in short-form content with the launch of YouTube Shorts, a feature introduced to compete with TikTok and Instagram Reels. By 2024, YouTube Shorts had surpassed <strong>70 billion daily views</strong> globally <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>. Forrester Research reports that <strong>29% of U.S. Gen Z</strong> online adults now use YouTube Shorts at least weekly, underscoring how bite-sized video is reshaping attention spans and engagement patterns <a href="#ref3">[3]</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    What makes YouTube unique is not just its scale, but the way it handles business-critical challenges such as content recommendation, ad targeting, trend detection, and moderation. Its backend is deeply rooted in a backbone of data structures and algorithms (DSA). Whether it's ranking the best video for a user, optimizing live video delivery, or filtering spam, YouTube‚Äôs success lies in its algorithmic problem-solving capabilities.
  </p>

  <p>
    This portfolio explores YouTube‚Äôs real-world business cases and demonstrates how core DSA techniques can be applied to model and solve them efficiently.

### üèóÔ∏è YouTube System Architecture Overview
Having spent hours surfing YouTube every day, I‚Äôve often found myself wondering:
><em>‚ÄúHow does all of this actually work?‚Äù</em><br>
><em>‚ÄúHow are videos fetched so efficiently?‚Äù</em><br>
><em>‚ÄúHow is such a large amount of content, creator, and viewer data stored?‚Äù</em><br>
><em>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt the servers get overloaded with requests? how is that managed?‚Äù</em><br>
><em>‚ÄúHow are video bitrates adapted?‚Äù</em><br>
><em>‚ÄúHow does the video recommendation work?‚Äù</em><br>
><em>‚ÄúHow is content violating DMCA detected?‚Äù</em><br>

<div class="justified">
  <p>
    Below is a concise overview of how YouTube‚Äôs core systems handle video from upload through delivery. This high-level architecture lays the groundwork for the business cases we‚Äôll explore next.

<div class="justified">
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>User Client ‚Üí Upload Servers</strong><br />
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Creators</strong> upload raw video files via web or mobile clients.</li>
        <li>Requests pass through a <strong>load balancer</strong> to an <strong>Upload/Web Server</strong>, which writes the file into durable blob storage.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Transcoding & Storage</strong><br />
      <ul>
        <li>A fleet of <strong>Transcoding Servers</strong> retrieves uploads and encodes them into multiple resolutions (144p, 480p, 1080p, etc.).</li>
        <li>Transcoded segments are stored in a distributed <strong>Video Storage</strong> layer; metadata (titles, IDs, thumbnails) is indexed in a <strong>Metadata Store</strong> (e.g., Bigtable, Spanner).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Content Delivery Network (CDN)</strong><br />
      <ul>
        <li>Popular and newly uploaded content is replicated to edge <strong>CDN</strong> nodes worldwide.</li>
        <li>Viewers fetch video chunks from the nearest CDN via adaptive-bitrate protocols (MPEG-DASH, HLS) to minimize latency.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Viewer Playback Path</strong><br />
      <ul>
        <li>A <strong>Viewer</strong> requests a video; the client contacts the closest CDN edge.</li>
        <li>Cache misses trigger a fetch from the origin storage.</li>
        <li><strong>Adaptive streaming algorithms</strong> and <strong>real-time analytics</strong> determine the optimal segment quality.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Metadata & Recommendations</strong><br />
      <ul>
        <li>The client‚Äôs API calls hit the <strong>API Server</strong>, which queries the <strong>Metadata Store</strong> for user history and video stats.</li>
        <li><strong>Recommendation engines</strong> (graph-based, collaborative filtering) generate personalized ‚ÄúUp Next‚Äù and homepage feeds.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    This end-to-end pipeline built on load balancers, distributed storage, transcoding clusters, CDNs, and recommendation services forms the foundation for all the business-critical scenarios in this portfolio. In the sections that follow, we‚Äôll dive into specific cases and show how Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) techniques solve them efficiently.

## üíº Business Cases

### I. Ingestion & Storage

#### 1. Optimal Video Upload Scheduling  
<p class="justified">We split a creator‚Äôs large video into chunks and schedule parallel uploads to regional servers. A dynamic-programming planner weighs chunk sizes against server load and network delays ensuring fast, balanced ingestion.</p>  
**Design Technique / Algorithm:** Dynamic Programming<br>  
<a href="./01.html" class="button">More ‚ñ∂Ô∏è</a>

#### 2. Copyright Fingerprint Scanning

**Design Technique / Algorithm:** Trie<br>  
<a href="./12.html" class="button">More ‚ñ∂Ô∏è</a>

#### 13. Search Spell Correction  
<p class="justified">When users mistype, we combine Trie lookups with edit-distance calculations to suggest the closest valid queries, minimizing zero-result searches and keeping users on track.</p>  
**Design Technique / Algorithm:** Trie + Edit Distance<br>  
<a href="./13.html" class="button">More ‚ñ∂Ô∏è</a>

#### 14. Spam Comment Filtering  
<p class="justified">Incoming comments are first checked against a Bloom filter of banned phrases. Suspects get escalated to deeper NLP checks, keeping abuse rates low without slowing down posting.</p>  
**Design Technique / Algorithm:** Bloom Filter<br>  
<a href="./14.html" class="button">More ‚ñ∂Ô∏è</a>

#### 15. User Profiling & Segmentation  
<p class="justified">We cluster viewers by watch patterns and engagement behaviors using Union-Find on a similarity graph. These segments feed personalized search rankings and targeted recommendation models.</p>  
**Design Technique / Algorithm:** Union-Find<br>  
<a href="./15.html" class="button">More ‚ñ∂Ô∏è</a>
