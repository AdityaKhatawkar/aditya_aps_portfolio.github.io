## Introduction

<div class="justified">
  <p>
    Founded in 2005 and acquired by Google in 2006, YouTube has evolved from a simple video-sharing site into a massive, data-driven platform that powers content discovery, creator monetization, and user engagement at a global scale. With over <strong>2.7 billion monthly active users</strong> and more than <strong>500 hours of video uploaded every minute</strong>, YouTube operates at an unmatched scale, requiring advanced algorithmic intelligence to manage and optimize operations <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    In recent years, YouTube has witnessed a massive boom in short-form content with the launch of YouTube Shorts, a feature introduced to compete with TikTok and Instagram Reels. By 2024, YouTube Shorts had surpassed <strong>70 billion daily views</strong> globally <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>. Forrester Research reports that <strong>29% of U.S. Gen Z</strong> online adults now use YouTube Shorts at least weekly, underscoring how bite-sized video is reshaping attention spans and engagement patterns <a href="#ref3">[3]</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    What makes YouTube unique is not just its scale, but the way it handles business-critical challenges such as content recommendation, ad targeting, trend detection, and moderation. Its backend is deeply rooted in a backbone of data structures and algorithms (DSA). Whether it's ranking the best video for a user, optimizing live video delivery, or filtering spam, YouTube‚Äôs success lies in its algorithmic problem-solving capabilities.

  <p>
    This portfolio explores YouTube‚Äôs real-world business cases and demonstrates how core DSA techniques can be applied to model and solve them efficiently.

### üèóÔ∏è YouTube System Architecture Overview
Having spent hours surfing YouTube every day, I‚Äôve often found myself wondering:
><em>‚ÄúHow does all of this actually work?‚Äù</em><br>
><em>‚ÄúHow are videos fetched so efficiently?‚Äù</em><br>
><em>‚ÄúHow is such a large amount of content, creator, and viewer data stored?‚Äù</em><br>
><em>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt the servers get overloaded with requests? how is that managed?‚Äù</em><br>
><em>‚ÄúHow are video bitrates adapted?‚Äù</em><br>
><em>‚ÄúHow does the video recommendation work?‚Äù</em><br>
><em>‚ÄúHow is content violating DMCA detected?‚Äù</em><br>

Below is a concise overview of how YouTube‚Äôs core systems handle video from upload through delivery. This high-level architecture lays the groundwork for the business cases we‚Äôll explore next.

    <li>
      <strong>User Client ‚Üí Upload Servers</strong><br />
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Creators</strong> upload raw video files via web or mobile clients.</li>
        <li>Requests pass through a <strong>load balancer</strong> to an <strong>Upload/Web Server</strong>, which writes the file into durable blob storage.</li>

        <li>Transcoded segments are stored in a distributed <strong>Video Storage</strong> layer; metadata (titles, IDs, thumbnails) is indexed in a <strong>Metadata Store</strong> (e.g., Bigtable, Spanner).</li>

      <strong>Viewer Playback Path</strong><br />
      <ul>
        <li>A <strong>Viewer</strong> requests a video; the client contacts the closest CDN edge.</li>
        <li>Cache misses trigger a fetch from the origin storage.</li>
        <li><strong>Adaptive streaming algorithms</strong> and <strong>real-time analytics</strong> determine the optimal segment quality.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Metadata & Recommendations</strong><br />
      <ul>
        <li>The client‚Äôs API calls hit the <strong>API Server</strong>, which queries the <strong>Metadata Store</strong> for user history and video stats.</li>
        <li><strong>Recommendation engines</strong> (graph-based, collaborative filtering) generate personalized ‚ÄúUp Next‚Äù and homepage feeds.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    This end-to-end pipeline built on load balancers, distributed storage, transcoding clusters, CDNs, and recommendation services forms the foundation for all the business-critical scenarios in this portfolio. In the sections that follow, we‚Äôll dive into specific cases and show how Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) techniques solve them efficiently.

## üíº Business Cases
### I. Content Delivery and Infrastructure

YouTube‚Äôs backend must handle uploading, transcoding, storage, and streaming to millions of devices. The key is fast retrieval and minimal latency. Services are replicated across regions, and popular content is pushed to edge servers (CDNs) [5]. Efficient algorithms are used for routing, load balancing, and data placement.

#### 1. Content Delivery Network (CDN) Server Selection
When serving a video stream, YouTube must select the nearest CDN edge server or region to minimize latency. Given a user‚Äôs geographic location, we want the closest server.

**Algorithm:** KD-Tree Nearest-Neighbor Search

#### 2. Shortest-Path Routing in CDN Network
Once YouTube selects a CDN edge region to serve the user, the system must determine how to route the request through the network to that destination with minimal latency.

**Algorithm:** A* Graph Search

<a href="./02.html" class="button">More ‚ñ∂Ô∏è</a>

#### 3. Content Delivery Network (CDN) Optimization
To ensure YouTube‚Äôs video content reaches users quickly and reliably, Google must optimize the underlying physical network that connects data centers, edge servers, and backbone links.

**Algorithm:** Bor≈Øvka‚Äôs Algorithm for Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
