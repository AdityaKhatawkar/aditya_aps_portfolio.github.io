## Introduction
![Google Logo](/assets/images/youtube_logo.png)

<div class="justified">
  <p>
    Founded in 2005 and acquired by Google in 2006, YouTube has evolved from a simple video-sharing site into a massive, data-driven platform that powers content discovery, creator monetization, and user engagement at a global scale. With over <strong>2.7 billion monthly active users</strong> and more than <strong>500 hours of video uploaded every minute</strong>, YouTube operates at an unmatched scale, requiring advanced algorithmic intelligence to manage and optimize operations <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    In recent years, YouTube has witnessed a massive boom in short-form content with the launch of YouTube Shorts, a feature introduced to compete with TikTok and Instagram Reels. By 2024, YouTube Shorts had surpassed <strong>70 billion daily views</strong> globally <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>. Forrester Research reports that <strong>29% of U.S. Gen Z</strong> online adults now use YouTube Shorts at least weekly, underscoring how bite-sized video is reshaping attention spans and engagement patterns <a href="#ref3">[3]</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    What makes YouTube unique is not just its scale, but the way it handles business-critical challenges such as content recommendation, ad targeting, trend detection, and moderation. Its backend is deeply rooted in a backbone of data structures and algorithms (DSA). Whether it's ranking the best video for a user, optimizing live video delivery, or filtering spam, YouTube’s success lies in its algorithmic problem-solving capabilities.
  </p>

  <p>
    This portfolio explores YouTube’s real-world business cases and demonstrates how core DSA techniques can be applied to model and solve them efficiently.

### 🏗️ YouTube System Architecture Overview
Having spent hours surfing YouTube every day, I’ve often found myself wondering:
><em>“How does all of this actually work?”</em><br>
><em>“How are videos fetched so efficiently?”</em><br>
><em>“How is such a large amount of content, creator, and viewer data stored?”</em><br>
><em>“Don’t the servers get overloaded with requests? how is that managed?”</em><br>
><em>“How are video bitrates adapted?”</em><br>
><em>“How does the video recommendation work?”</em><br>
><em>“How is content violating DMCA detected?”</em><br>

<div class="justified">
  <p>
    Below is a concise overview of how YouTube’s core systems handle video from upload through delivery. This high-level architecture lays the groundwork for the business cases we’ll explore next.

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>User Client → Upload Servers</strong><br />
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Creators</strong> upload raw video files via web or mobile clients.</li>
        <li>Requests pass through a <strong>load balancer</strong> to an <strong>Upload/Web Server</strong>, which writes the file into durable blob storage.</li>

        <li>A fleet of <strong>Transcoding Servers</strong> retrieves uploads and encodes them into multiple resolutions (144p, 480p, 1080p, etc.).</li>
        <li>Transcoded segments are stored in a distributed <strong>Video Storage</strong> layer; metadata (titles, IDs, thumbnails) is indexed in a <strong>Metadata Store</strong> (e.g., Bigtable, Spanner).</li>

      <strong>Content Delivery Network (CDN)</strong><br />

      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>

      <ul>

    <li>
      <strong>Metadata & Recommendations</strong><br />
      <ul>
        <li>The client’s API calls hit the <strong>API Server</strong>, which queries the <strong>Metadata Store</strong> for user history and video stats.</li>
        <li><strong>Recommendation engines</strong> (graph-based, collaborative filtering) generate personalized “Up Next” and homepage feeds.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    This end-to-end pipeline built on load balancers, distributed storage, transcoding clusters, CDNs, and recommendation services forms the foundation for all the business-critical scenarios in this portfolio. In the sections that follow, we’ll dive into specific cases and show how Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) techniques solve them efficiently.

## 💼 Business Cases
### I. Content Delivery and Infrastructure

<div class="justified">
YouTube’s backend must handle uploading, transcoding, storage, and streaming to millions of devices. The key is fast retrieval and minimal latency. Services are replicated across regions, and popular content is pushed to edge servers (CDNs) [5]. Efficient algorithms are used for routing, load balancing, and data placement.
</div>

#### 1. Content Delivery Network (CDN) Server Selection
<div class="justified">
When serving a video stream, YouTube must select the nearest CDN edge server or region to minimize latency. Given a user’s geographic location, we want the closest server.
</div>

**Design Technique / Algorithm:** KD-Tree Nearest-Neighbor Search  
<a href="./01.html" class="button">More ▶️</a>

#### 2. Shortest-Path Routing in CDN Network
<div class="justified">
Once YouTube selects a CDN edge region to serve the user, the system must determine how to route the request through the network to that destination with minimal latency.
</div>

**Design Technique / Algorithm:** A* Graph Search  
<a href="./02.html" class="button">More ▶️</a>

#### 3. Optimal Video Upload Scheduling
<div class="justified">
When a creator uploads a large video, it is split into smaller chunks and sent to multiple regional upload servers (nearby CDNs) to reduce latency.
</div>

**Design Technique / Algorithm:** Dynamic Programming  
<a href="./03.html" class="button">More ▶️</a>

#### 4. Content Delivery Network (CDN) Optimization
<div class="justified">
To ensure YouTube’s video content reaches users quickly and reliably, Google must optimize the underlying physical network that connects data centers, edge servers, and backbone links.

When millions of users stream videos, YouTube caches popular content at edge servers. To keep cache memory efficient, old or rarely accessed videos must be evicted smartly.
</div>

**Design Technique / Algorithm:** LRU Cache Policy  
<a href="./05.html" class="button">More ▶️</a>

#### 6. Storage-Aware Server Assignment
<div class="justified">

</div>

**Design Technique / Algorithm:** Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm  
<a href="./11.html" class="button">More ▶️</a>

#### 12. Playlist Permutations (Shuffle)  
<div class="justified">
To offer fair and non-repetitive shuffle in playlists, YouTube uses a permutation algorithm that cycles through all song/video orders exactly once.
</div>

**Design Technique / Algorithm:** Johnson–Trotter Algorithm  
<a href="./12.html" class="button">More ▶️</a>

#### 13. Autocomplete Search Query  
<div class="justified">
When a user starts typing a search query, YouTube must suggest possible completions in real-time based on prefix matching from billions of past queries.
</div>

**Design Technique / Algorithm:** Trie  
<a href="./13.html" class="button">More ▶️</a>

#### 14. Copyright Detection  
<div class="justified">

</div>

**Design Technique / Algorithm:** Rabin–Karp / Rolling Hash  
<a href="./14.html" class="button">More ▶️</a>

#### 15. Spam Comment Filter  
<div class="justified">
To protect creators and users from spam, YouTube uses a fast and memory-efficient algorithm to check incoming comments against a blacklist of banned phrases.
</div>

**Design Technique / Algorithm:** Bloom Filter  
<a href="./15.html" class="button">More ▶️</a>

#### 16. Trending Video Detection  
<div class="justified">
YouTube identifies rapidly rising videos by monitoring view counts over recent sliding windows of time, helping curate the “Trending” section.
</div>

**Design Technique / Algorithm:** Sliding Window  
<a href="./16.html" class="button">More ▶️</a>

#### 17. Channel Collaboration Clustering
