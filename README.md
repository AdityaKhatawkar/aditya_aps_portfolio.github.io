## Introduction
![Google Logo](/assets/images/youtube_logo.png)

Founded in 2005 and acquired by Google in 2006, YouTube has evolved from a simple video-sharing site into a massive, data-driven platform that powers content discovery, creator monetization, and user engagement at a global scale. With over 2.7 billion monthly active users and more than 500 hours of video uploaded every minute, YouTube operates at an unmatched scale, requiring advanced algorithmic intelligence to manage and optimize operations [1]. In recent years, YouTube has witnessed a massive boom in short-form content with the launch of YouTube Shorts, a feature introduced to compete with TikTok and Instagram Reels. By 2024, YouTube Shorts had surpassed 70 billion daily views globally [2]. Forrester Research reports that 29% of U.S. Gen Z online adults now use YouTube Shorts at least weekly—underscoring how bite-sized video is reshaping attention spans and engagement patterns [3].

What makes YouTube unique is not just its scale, but the way it handles business-critical challenges such as, content recommendation, ad targeting, trend detection, and moderation, usingis deeply rooted a backbone of data structures and algorithms (DSA). Whether it's ranking the best video for a user, optimizing live video delivery, or filtering spam, YouTube’s success  in algorithmic problem-solving.

This portfolio explores YouTube’s real-world business cases and demonstrates how core DSA techniques can be applied to model and solve them efficiently.

## 🧩 The YouTube Ecosystem

To serve a wide range of audiences and monetize effectively, YouTube has developed a diverse product ecosystem — each with its own algorithms, data pipelines, and engineering challenges:

### 🎵 YouTube Music
A music streaming platform offering official tracks, remixes, live performances, and personalized playlists. Competes with Spotify and Apple Music.  
**DSA Applications:** Collaborative filtering, genre-based clustering, k-nearest neighbors (KNN).

---

### 📺 YouTube TV
A live TV streaming service offering 100+ channels, DVR support, and real-time sports broadcasting.  
**DSA Applications:** Real-time content scheduling, load balancing, greedy allocation, network optimization.

---

### 🧒 YouTube Kids
A child-friendly version of YouTube with strict content filters and parental controls.  
**DSA Applications:** Content classification algorithms, string matching (KMP/Aho-Corasick), moderation systems.

---

### ✂️ YouTube Shorts
A short-form vertical video format with content under 60 seconds, designed to compete with TikTok and Reels.  
**DSA Applications:** Watch-time analysis, heap-based ranking, sliding window algorithms, real-time trend detection.

---

### 💼 YouTube Premium
A subscription service offering ad-free viewing, offline downloads, and background play.  
**DSA Applications:** Offline video compression (greedy, Huffman coding), content caching, user preference modeling using dynamic programming.

---

### 🎮 YouTube Gaming
Focused on live game streams, walkthroughs, and esports content. Now merged into the main YouTube app.  
**DSA Applications:** Real-time stream optimization, chat moderation (Bloom filters), low-latency delivery using queue-based models.

---

Each product introduces unique algorithmic problems, and collectively, they form a rich environment for solving real-world business cases using core DSA techniques.

## 💼 Business Cases
### 1. YouTube Video Comments Management

Managing the vast number of comments on YouTube videos requires intelligent systems to filter spam, detect toxicity, and highlight meaningful interactions. This business case explores how backend systems and algorithms can improve user engagement and maintain community standards.

### 2. YouTube Copyright Infringement Detection

With millions of videos uploaded daily, YouTube faces the challenge of identifying copyrighted content in real-time. This business case focuses on how data structures, pattern matching, and scalable backend systems can help detect and handle copyright violations efficiently.

### 3. Cost-Optimized Resource Allocation in Google Cloud billing

Google Cloud dynamically allocates resources based on cost and performance constraints. This problem can be modeled using **DP (Knapsack-like problems)** where the goal is to maximize resource usage within a cost or performance budget.
