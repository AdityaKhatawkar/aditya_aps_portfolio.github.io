## Introduction
![Google Logo](/assets/images/google-icon.png)

Google LLC is a global technology powerhouse, best known for its flagship product - the Google Search engine. But its reach extends far beyond that. With services like **Gmail, Google Maps, YouTube, Google Drive, Google Cloud, Android**, and more, Google has built an entire ecosystem that impacts billions of users across the globe.

Google was chosen as the domain of focus due to its **evergrowing nature**, constant innovation, and the **vast number of services** it offers. Each of these services is powered by advanced algorithms, robust backend systems, and scalable architectures, all of which are prime ground for exploring how algorithmic thinking and backend development solve problems at scale.

From real-time content delivery to intelligent recommendation engines, Google's infrastructure embodies real-world applications of **efficiency, optimization**, and **data-driven design**, making it a compelling and relevant space for technical exploration.

> “Google’s mission is to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.”  
> That mission is realized through powerful, intelligent, and resilient systems built on problem-solving fundamentals.

## 💼 Business Cases
### 1. YouTube Video Comments Management

Managing the vast number of comments on YouTube videos requires intelligent systems to filter spam, detect toxicity, and highlight meaningful interactions. This business case explores how backend systems and algorithms can improve user engagement and maintain community standards.

### 2. YouTube Copyright Infringement Detection

With millions of videos uploaded daily, YouTube faces the challenge of identifying copyrighted content in real-time. This business case focuses on how data structures, pattern matching, and scalable backend systems can help detect and handle copyright violations efficiently.

### 3. Cost-Optimized Resource Allocation in Google Cloud billing

Google Cloud dynamically allocates resources based on cost and performance constraints. This problem can be modeled using **DP (Knapsack-like problems)** where the goal is to maximize resource usage within a cost or performance budget.
